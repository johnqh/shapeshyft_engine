/**
 * What a provider calls its cap on generated tokens.
 *
 * `OpenAIProvider` serves OpenAI itself *and* every OpenAI-compatible third
 * party (DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Perplexity, Cohere), and the two do not share
 * a vocabulary here. OpenAI's reasoning-era models reject `max_tokens` with
 * "Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not supported with this model. Use
 * 'max_completion_tokens' instead", while the compatible providers know only
 * `max_tokens` — so sending the new name to them would break every one.
 *
 * Both halves of the decision matter, which is why this takes a model as well
 * as a provider: the model is chosen per endpoint, so it cannot be settled when
 * the client is constructed.
